            <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">
                <strong>SEBI classifies stocks by market capitalization:</strong> Large Cap = Top 100 companies (above Rs 1,05,000 crore), Mid Cap = 101-250 (Rs 34,700 cr to Rs 1,05,000 cr), Small Cap = 251+ (below Rs 34,700 crore). For most investors, experts recommend 50-65% large cap, 25-35% mid cap, and 10-20% small cap. Mid caps offer the best risk-adjusted returns, outperforming large caps 98% of the time on 10-year rolling returns. Small caps gave 47% in 2023 but crashed 80% for many stocks in 2025 - they take 5+ years to recover from major crashes vs 2.5 years for large caps.

            <p><strong>Vikram couldn't believe his eyes.</strong> His portfolio had shown Rs 47 lakhs just 18 months ago. Now? Rs 12 lakhs. A stomach-churning 74% loss.</p>
            <p>"But these were multibaggers!" he told his wife, scrolling through his holdings. TV Vision - down 78%. Noida Toll Bridge - down 69%. Williamson Financial - down 69%. Stocks that had given him 200-500% returns between 2021 and 2024 had given back EVERYTHING - and then some.</p>
            <p>His colleague Meera, who had stuck to "boring" large caps and some mid caps, was only down 13%. She'd been mocked for "missing the rally." Now she was the only one sleeping peacefully at night.</p>
            <p>Vikram learned what the market teaches every cycle: <strong>small caps give, and small caps take away.</strong> The question isn't whether to invest in small caps - it's how much, and whether you can stomach watching 80% of your "multibagger" gains evaporate in months.</p>
            <p>This is the complete guide to market cap categories that Vikram wishes he'd read two years ago.</p>

            <h2>What is Market Capitalization?</h2>

            <p><strong>Market capitalization (market cap) is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares.</strong> It's the single most important metric for classifying stocks in India.</p>

            <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1E3A5F 0%, #0f172a 100%); color: white; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 12px; margin: 2rem 0;">

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <strong>Market Cap = Share Price x Total Outstanding Shares</strong>

                <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Mid caps have the BEST risk-adjusted returns (highest Sharpe ratio at 0.65). Small caps have higher absolute returns but LOWER risk-adjusted returns because of extreme volatility. The "extra" small cap returns don't compensate for the extra risk.

                <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The 47% index return masked that it was driven by a subset of stocks. Many "multibaggers" gave back 80%+ of gains. Retail investors who bought near the top are now underwater, and liquidity dried up exactly when people needed to sell.

            <h3>Key Allocation Principles</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start with Large Caps:</strong> Build your core portfolio with stable, blue-chip stocks</li>
                <li><strong>Add Mid Caps for Growth:</strong> Gradually increase as you gain experience</li>
                <li><strong>Small Caps as Satellites:</strong> Never exceed 20-25% even for aggressive investors</li>
                <li><strong>Rebalance Annually:</strong> Reset to target allocation yearly or when deviation >5%</li>
                <li><strong>Reduce Risk with Age:</strong> Shift from small to large caps as you approach goals</li>

                <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;"><strong>Why it's a problem:</strong> Small caps that gave 47% in 2023 are often overvalued by the time you invest</p>

                <strong>Mistake #4: Not Rebalancing After a Rally</strong>
                <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;"><strong>Why it's a problem:</strong> If small caps rally 50%, your 15% allocation becomes 21% - overexposure to risky assets</p>
                <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;"><strong>Better approach:</strong> Rebalance annually or when allocation drifts >5% from target</p>

                <strong>Mistake #5: Selling Large Caps to Buy Small Caps</strong>
                <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;"><strong>Why it's a problem:</strong> This is "classic late-cycle optimism" - selling stable assets to chase momentum</p>
                <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;"><strong>Better approach:</strong> Add to small caps from new savings, not by selling large caps</p>

                    <h3>What is market capitalization and how is it calculated?</h3>
                    <p>Market capitalization (market cap) is calculated by multiplying a company's share price by its total number of outstanding shares. For example, a company with 10 crore shares trading at Rs 100 has a market cap of Rs 1,000 crore. Market cap determines whether a stock is classified as large, mid, or small cap.</p>

                    <h3>How does SEBI classify large cap, mid cap, and small cap stocks in India?</h3>
                    <p>SEBI classifies stocks based on full market capitalization ranking: Large Cap = top 100 companies (above Rs 1,05,000 crore as of January 2026), Mid Cap = 101st to 250th companies (Rs 34,700 crore to Rs 1,05,000 crore), Small Cap = 251st company onwards (below Rs 34,700 crore). This list is maintained by AMFI and updated every 6 months.</p>

                    <h3>Which category gives the best returns - large cap, mid cap, or small cap?</h3>
                    <p>While small caps have delivered higher absolute returns historically (15-25% CAGR), mid caps offer better risk-adjusted returns. Mid cap indices outperformed large caps 98% of the time on 10-year rolling returns, while small caps outperformed only 69% of the time. Mid caps have a Sharpe ratio of 0.65 vs 0.46 for small caps.</p>

                    <h3>How long does it take for small caps to recover from a market crash?</h3>
                    <p>Small caps take significantly longer to recover than large caps. During the 2008 crash, the Sensex (large cap) recovered in approximately 2.5 years, while small caps took 5+ years. In the 2020 COVID crash, large caps recovered in 4 months, while small caps took 8-12 months. This recovery time difference is a critical risk factor.</p>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                    <h3>How much should I allocate to each market cap category based on my age?</h3>
                    <p>For balanced investors, experts recommend: Age 20-35 (aggressive): 45-55% large cap, 25-35% mid cap, 15-25% small cap. Age 35-50 (moderate): 55-65% large cap, 25-30% mid cap, 10-15% small cap. Age 50+ (conservative): 70-80% large cap, 15-25% mid cap, 0-5% small cap. Always adjust based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.</p>

                    <h3>What is the difference between flexi-cap and multi-cap funds?</h3>
                    <p>Multi-cap funds MUST invest minimum 25% each in large, mid, and small caps (75% total minimum equity). Flexi-cap funds have complete flexibility - they only need 65% in equity with no fixed category allocation, allowing fund managers to adjust based on market conditions. Flexi-cap is better if you trust your fund manager to time market cycles.</p>

                    <h3>Why did small cap stocks crash in 2025 after giving 47% returns in 2023?</h3>
                    <p>The 2025 small cap crash happened because: (1) Valuations reached unsustainable levels with many stocks trading at PE >50x, (2) FII outflows created a liquidity crisis, (3) Earnings growth did not match price appreciation, (4) Retail investors were trapped in illiquid positions. Stocks like TV Vision fell 78% after giving 850% returns in 2023-24.</p>
