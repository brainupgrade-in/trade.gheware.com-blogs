            <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">
                <strong>The risk-return relationship is the fundamental principle that higher potential returns require accepting higher investment risk.</strong> To beat inflation, you must accept at least one of three risks: price volatility, credit risk, or liquidity risk. Historical data shows equity (Nifty 50) delivered 14-16% CAGR over 20 years, while "safe" FDs gave only 6-7% - barely beating inflation. This means Rs 1 lakh in equity grew to Rs 19 lakhs versus just Rs 2.5 lakhs in FDs over 20 years.

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk-Return Tradeoff:</strong> Higher potential returns require accepting higher risk - there's no "safe" path to beating inflation significantly</li>
                <li><strong>Three Core Risks:</strong> To earn returns above inflation, you must take at least one risk: price volatility, credit risk, or liquidity risk</li>
                <li><strong>Equity for Long-Term:</strong> Historical data shows equity's 14-16% CAGR beats debt's 7-10% over 15+ years, with time reducing volatility risk</li>
                <li><strong>Diversification Reduces Risk:</strong> Spreading investments across 15-20 stocks eliminates company-specific (unsystematic) risk</li>
                <li><strong>Know Your Risk Tolerance:</strong> Match portfolio allocation to your actual risk capacity (financial + emotional) - not theoretical tolerance</li>
                <li><strong>Debt Isn't Risk-Free:</strong> Debt funds carry interest rate risk - long-duration funds fell 8-10% in 2022 during RBI rate hikes</li>

            <p><strong>Priya stared at her father's investment statements, confused and frustrated.</strong> For 25 years, he had religiously put money into "safe" Fixed Deposits - never touching the stock market because it was "too risky." Now at retirement, his Rs 1 lakh investment had grown to Rs 2.5 lakhs. Meanwhile, her colleague Amit's father had invested the same amount in a simple Nifty 50 index fund. His portfolio? Rs 19 lakhs.</p>
            <p>The difference wasn't luck or timing. It was understanding one fundamental truth about investing that 90.5% of Indians still don't know - the real relationship between risk and return.</p>

        <section id="the-90-percent-problem">
            <h2>The 90% Problem: Why Indians Avoid Stock Markets</h2>

            <p>Here's a statistic that should shock you: <strong>While 63% of Indians are aware of capital markets, only 9.5% actually invest in them.</strong> That's a 54% awareness-participation gap - one of the largest in any developing economy.</p>

            <aside style="background: #fef2f2; border-left: 4px solid #ef4444; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                <strong>The Hidden Cost of "Safety"</strong>
                <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">According to SEBI's investor survey, fear of loss, perceived complexity, and limited financial literacy keep 90.5% of Indians away from stock markets. The irony? This "safety" is costing them Rs 16.5 lakhs over 20 years on every Rs 1 lakh invested.</p>
            </aside>

            <p>The problem isn't that Indians are risk-averse - it's that they don't understand what risk actually means. They see equity's short-term volatility and run to FDs, not realizing that the "safe" choice is quietly destroying their wealth through inflation.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; font-weight: 600; color: #1e40af; margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1rem; background: #eff6ff; border-radius: 8px;">
                But here's the real question: What if the "risky" investment is actually safer for your long-term goals?
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: Risk-Return Relationship -->
        <section id="risk-return-relationship">
            <h2>What is the Risk-Return Relationship?</h2>

            <p><strong>Investment risk is the uncertainty about expected returns.</strong> If returns are guaranteed (like a bank FD up to Rs 5 lakh), there is minimal risk. But here's what most Indians miss: guaranteed low returns carry their own risk - the risk of not meeting your financial goals.</p>

            <p>The National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) puts it clearly: "To beat inflation, one must take at least one of the three risks: price volatility, credit risk, or illiquidity. Assets that do not take any of these risks often deliver lower returns than inflation."</p>

            <aside style="background: #fef3c7; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Higher risk does NOT guarantee higher returns - it only creates the POSSIBILITY of higher returns along with higher potential losses. The goal isn't to avoid risk, but to take calculated risks aligned with your goals.

            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Despite wild swings from -3.44% to +26.82%, patient investors who stayed through all five years earned healthy returns. Volatility is the price of equity returns - not a bug, but a feature.</p>

            <h3>2. Credit Risk (Default Risk)</h3>
            <p>Credit risk is the chance that a borrower fails to repay. This affects corporate bonds, debentures, and debt mutual funds.</p>

            <div style="background: #f8fafc; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                <strong>Credit Rating Scale in India:</strong>
                <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">
                    <li><strong>AAA:</strong> Highest safety, lowest yield (7-7.5%)</li>
                    <li><strong>AA/A:</strong> Moderate safety, moderate yield (8-8.5%)</li>
                    <li><strong>BBB and below:</strong> Higher risk, higher credit spread</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Interest Rate Risk</h3>
            <p>This is the risk most Indians don't know about until it hits them. When RBI raises interest rates, existing bond values fall.</p>

            <aside style="background: #fef2f2; border-left: 4px solid #ef4444; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">

                <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">When RBI hiked repo rates from 4% to 6.5% in 2022, long-duration debt funds fell 8-10%, shocking investors who thought "debt = safe."</p>
            </aside>

            <h3>4. Inflation Risk (The Silent Wealth Killer)</h3>
            <p>This is the risk nobody talks about - the risk that your money loses purchasing power over time.</p>

                Read that again: After tax and inflation, your "safe" FD is actually LOSING money every year. The "risky" equity fund is building real wealth.

            <h2>How to Assess Your Risk Tolerance</h2>

            <p>Risk tolerance isn't just about what you think you can handle - it's what you'll actually do when markets crash 20%. It has three components:</p>

            <h3>1. Financial Capacity (Can You Afford to Lose?)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emergency fund:</strong> 6-12 months of expenses in liquid savings</li>
                <li><strong>Income stability:</strong> Stable salary vs irregular business income</li>
                <li><strong>Debt obligations:</strong> High EMIs reduce risk capacity</li>
                <li><strong>Dependents:</strong> More dependents = lower risk capacity</li>
                <li><strong>Time horizon:</strong> Longer = higher risk capacity</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>What is the relationship between risk and return in investing?</h3>
                    <p>The risk-return relationship states that higher potential returns typically require accepting higher investment risk. Low-risk investments like FDs offer 6-7% returns, while higher-risk equity can deliver 14-16% long-term CAGR. To beat inflation significantly, investors must accept at least one of three risks: price volatility, credit risk, or illiquidity.</p>

                    <h3>What are the main types of investment risk in India?</h3>
                    <p>The three primary investment risks are: (1) Price Volatility Risk - fluctuations in market prices of stocks and bonds; (2) Credit Risk - risk that borrower fails to repay (measured by credit ratings); and (3) Liquidity Risk - inability to quickly sell investments without price loss. Additional risks include inflation risk, interest rate risk, and currency risk.</p>

                    <h3>How do equity and debt fund returns compare in India?</h3>
                    <p>Historical data (2020-2026) shows equity delivered 10-26% annual returns with volatility (including -3.44% in 2022), while debt funds provided stable 7-10% returns. Over 20 years, equity (Nifty 50) grew 19x vs debt's 4x and FD's 2.5x, demonstrating equity's superior long-term wealth creation despite short-term volatility.</p>

                    <h3>What is the difference between systematic and unsystematic risk?</h3>
                    <p>Systematic risk (market risk) affects all investments and cannot be eliminated through diversification - examples include inflation, interest rate changes, or economic recession. Unsystematic risk (company-specific risk) affects individual stocks and can be reduced by diversifying across 15-20 different companies or using index funds.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                    <h3>How can Indian investors assess their risk tolerance?</h3>
                    <p>Risk tolerance assessment considers three factors: (1) Financial capacity - ability to absorb losses without impacting lifestyle; (2) Time horizon - longer periods allow recovery from volatility; (3) Emotional capacity - ability to stay invested during market crashes. Conservative investors suit 60-70% debt allocation, while aggressive long-term investors can handle 70-90% equity.</p>

                    <h3>Why do only 9.5% of Indians invest in stock markets despite awareness?</h3>
                    <p>SEBI's investor survey shows while 63% of Indians are aware of capital markets, only 9.5% participate due to fear of loss, perceived complexity, and limited financial literacy. This fear stems from misunderstanding risk - short-term volatility scares people away from equity's superior long-term returns.</p>

                    <h3>Can debt funds lose money like equity funds?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, debt funds carry interest rate risk and can deliver negative returns. In 2022, when RBI raised interest rates, long-duration debt funds fell by 8-10%, while their returns dropped from 10% (2020) to 2-3%. Debt funds are lower-risk than equity but not risk-free like bank FDs (which have sovereign guarantee up to Rs 5 lakh).</p>
