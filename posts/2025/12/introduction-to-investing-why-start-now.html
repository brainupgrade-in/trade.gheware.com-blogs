        <!-- Section: Why Investing Matters -->
        <section id="why-investing-matters">
            <h2>Why Investing Matters in 2025</h2>

            <h3>Economic Growth & Favorable Conditions</h3>
            <p>India continues to be one of the fastest-growing major economies globally in 2025, with GDP growth at 8.2% and the repo rate at 5.25%. This creates favorable conditions for retail investors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Domestic consumption expansion:</strong> Rising middle class with increased purchasing power</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing growth:</strong> "Make in India" initiatives driving industrial expansion</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure investment:</strong> Massive spending on roads, railways, airports</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Inflation Problem</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Inflation is silently reducing the value of your savings.</strong> What feels like Rs 1,00,000 today might be worth only around Rs 87,000 in real value after a few years if 6% inflation continues.</p>
            </div>

            <p>If you keep Rs 10 lakhs in a regular savings account earning 3-4% interest while inflation runs at 6%, you're effectively losing 2-3% of purchasing power every year. Over a decade, that's a significant erosion of wealth.</p>

            <h3>Democratization of Investing</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Over 16 crore Demat accounts exist in India as of March 2025, with 75% of new openings driven by young investors under 30.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zero-cost account opening:</strong> Brokers like Zerodha, Groww, Upstox offer free Demat accounts</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile-first platforms:</strong> Investing is now as easy as ordering food online</li>
                <li><strong>Fractional investing:</strong> Start with as little as Rs 100 in mutual funds</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: Power of Compounding -->
        <section id="power-of-compounding">
            <h2>The Power of Compounding</h2>

            <h3>Understanding Compounding</h3>
            <p>Compounding is often called the "eighth wonder of the world" because of its extraordinary wealth-creation potential. Unlike simple interest, compound interest means you earn returns on your returns - creating exponential growth.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Simple Example:</strong> If you invest Rs 100 at 5% annual compound interest, you earn Rs 5 in the first year. In the second year, interest is calculated on Rs 105, giving you Rs 5.25. This may seem small initially, but the effect becomes dramatic over longer periods.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Age 25 vs Age 35 Comparison</h3>
            <table>

        <!-- Section: Equity vs FD -->
        <section id="equity-vs-fd">
            <h2>Investment Returns: Equity vs Fixed Deposits</h2>

            <h3>Fixed Deposit Returns</h3>
            <p>FD rates range from 5-8% per annum. While they offer guaranteed returns and capital protection, they're fully taxable at your income slab rate.</p>

            <h3>Equity Investment Returns</h3>
            <p>Historical data shows equities have delivered 12-15% CAGR over 10-year periods. The Nifty 50 index has delivered around 13.7% annualized returns over 27 years.</p>

            <h3>Real Returns After Tax & Inflation</h3>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>

            </table>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> If you invest in an FD offering 8% with 6% inflation, your real return after adjusting for inflation and taxes becomes <strong>negative</strong>. Your money is actually losing value!</p>

            <div style="background: #f8fafc; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                    <h3>Why is investing better than a savings account?</h3>
                    <p>Savings accounts offer 3-4% interest, which doesn't keep pace with 6% inflation - your money loses purchasing power. Equity investments deliver 12-15% annual returns historically, helping you beat inflation and build real wealth.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                    <h3>What is the power of compounding?</h3>
                    <p>Compounding means earning returns on your returns - your investment grows exponentially rather than linearly. Even small monthly SIPs can create crores over decades due to compounding.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                    <h3>How do I start investing in India?</h3>
                    <p>Open a Demat account with a broker like Zerodha, Groww, or Upstox - it takes 24-48 hours with just PAN, Aadhaar, and bank details. Then start with SIPs in diversified mutual funds or index funds.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>How much should I invest monthly as a beginner?</h3>
                    <p>Start with an amount you can invest consistently - even Rs 1,000-5,000 monthly makes a difference with compounding. The key is consistency and starting early. Increase SIP amounts as your income grows.</p>
